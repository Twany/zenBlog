Needs Are Not Invented — They’re Forced Into Existence\n\nIn 2008, while studying at university in Perth, Melanie worked part-time teaching design classes. She noticed a painful reality: design tools at the time were clunky, desktop-only, and extremely hard to use. Beginners often needed years of training just to get started.\n\nAt the same time, Facebook was taking off — intuitive, frictionless, usable by anyone without training.\nThat contrast sparked an idea in Melanie’s mind: **what if design software could be simple, online, and collaborative?**\n\nShe also knew her limits. Taking on giants like Adobe head-on would have been irrational at that stage. So she reframed the problem: start with a narrow use case and apply the idea to school yearbooks.\n\nAt the time, producing school yearbooks in Australia required hundreds of hours. The project leaders were usually regular teachers — already busy with full-time teaching and with no design background. The market was desperate for a better solution.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The First Product Isn’t the “Best Solution” — It’s the “Usable One”\n\nMelanie didn’t wait until everything was ready. She created extremely detailed wireframes, borrowed money to hire an outsourced development team, and started working out of her living room.\n\n![First edition design of Fusion Books](/images/blog/first-version-of-canva-design.png)\n\nThe goal at this stage was crystal clear: not to build perfect software, but to validate **whether anyone was actually willing to pay for the solution**.\n\n> For many founders, this is the hardest step — because it requires accepting an imperfect beginning.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The First Customers Don’t Come from Growth Models — They Come from “Dumb Methods”\n\nAfter launch, they had no channels, no brand, and no marketing experience. So they used the most primitive customer-acquisition methods imaginable:\n\n-   **Direct mail blasts**: the whole family helped fold flyers, lick stamps, and mail brochures to schools across Australia.\n-   **Cold calls**: calling school administrators directly and mailing free yearbook samples.\n\nThe process was tedious, but critical. Fusion Books’ early profitability didn’t just keep the company alive — it taught the team sales, customer support, and product delivery from scratch. More importantly, it taught them _why_ users were willing to pay.\n\nDuring this period, Melanie learned something fundamental:\n\n> **Real business ability doesn’t come from frameworks. It comes from facing users directly — and building something valuable enough that people willingly pay for it.**\n\nWhen they received their very first $100 deposit, they even debated framing the check as a keepsake.\n\nThat’s what a first customer really means:\n**proof that this is worth continuing.**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fundraising Without a “Shiny Background”: Breaking Investor Bias\n\nAt the time, investors were hunting for a familiar archetype — a repeat of Mark Zuckerberg:\n\n-   Ivy League or top-tier university degrees\n-   Former employees of Google, Apple, or Facebook\n-   Rapidly rising growth charts\n\nAny deviation from this pattern was seen as a negative. Melanie seemed to check every “minus” box.\n\nBut she wasn’t starting from zero:\n\n-   **They had worked with hundreds of Australian schools, personally handling product development, marketing, sales, and customer service — giving them deep insight into real user needs.**\n-   **They had a clear vision for the future and knew exactly which problem they were solving.**\n\nTo break the stalemate, Melanie stayed in San Francisco for three months (originally planned for two weeks), sleeping on her brother’s floor.\n\n-   **Relentless meetings**: no matter how early or late, if someone would meet, she showed up.\n-   **Radical follow-through**: she once stayed awake for 36 hours straight to send a business plan before a promised deadline. The investor might not have cared — but Melanie did. If she said she’d do something, she did it. And the plan itself was high-quality — parts of it are still being executed today.\n    ![Melanie's pitch deck](/images/blog/melanie-pitch-deck.png)\n\n-   **Playing the long game**: when she learned that a key investor loved kite-surfing, she forced herself to learn it — despite a deep fear of losing control — just to attend the gathering.\n\nIn an email to investors, she wrote excitedly:\n\n> “Just got back from kite-surfing — can’t believe how fun it was!\n> Oh, and by the way, I’ve found an incredible technical lead willing to take a pay cut to join us…”\n\nThis almost obsessive persistence is what ultimately convinced their early investors.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Evolution of the Pitch Deck: How to Tell a Compelling Story\n\nCanva’s pitch deck went through dozens of iterations.\n\nMany investors didn’t understand the design industry, so they added a slide explaining the complexity of the design workflow:\n![Design workflow explanation](/images/blog/design-workflow-explanation.png)\n\nWhen investors couldn’t imagine a billion-dollar market, they added market-size analysis:\n![Market size analysis](/images/blog/market-size-analysis.png)\n\nTo explain Canva’s ambition — integrating the entire design ecosystem into a single, simple platform — they distilled it into one slide:\n\n![Canva's vision](/images/blog/canva-vision.png)\n\nInvestors often said, “Isn’t this just like Company X?”\nSo Canva moved competitive differentiation _earlier_ in the deck to preempt repetitive questions:\n\n![Market differentiation](/images/blog/market-differentiation.png)\n\nThey were also asked:\n“What if a big company spends $500 million to build this?”\n\nCanva’s answer: in major technological shifts, no dominant player lasts forever. Every era creates new market leaders.\n\n![Market disruption](/images/blog/market-disruption.png)\n\nEarly on, Melanie tried positioning Canva as an “inventor.” It didn’t work. On advice, they added Fusion Books’ revenue numbers — **$2M in revenue with 100% year-over-year growth** — proving they weren’t just storytellers, but operators with real traction.\n\nWhenever investors asked hard questions, the team updated the deck, **putting the hardest questions at the very beginning**. By the end of the pitch, there were few objections left.\n\n### Early Fundraising Reality: Hundreds of Pitches — What Changed?\n\nMelanie realized something crucial: instead of asking investors whether they wanted to invest, she asked for advice.\n\nThis removed the possibility of immediate rejection — and sparked genuine engagement. She then revised the deck based on that advice and followed up later, leaving room for continued dialogue.\n\nAs the number of “suggestions” decreased, their vision became clearer — and investor interest grew. They eventually closed their seed round.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Product Cold Start: Overcoming Users’ Fear\n\n### User Testing: Exposing the Real Problem\n\nBefore launch, Canva had 50,000 people on its waiting list. But user testing revealed a disaster:\n\nUsers hesitated to click. When they did, they wandered aimlessly, hit obstacles, and eventually left frustrated.\n\nThis was far from the joyful experience Canva envisioned. The team quickly realized the real barrier wasn’t just the tool — it was the psychological belief: _“I’m not a designer.”_\n\n### Onboarding Redesign: Changing User Perception\n\nCanva’s success depended on users having a great experience within minutes. So they completely rebuilt onboarding:\n\n-   No more blank canvas on first launch\n-   Introduced small tasks like “turn the circle red” or “put a hat on the monkey”\n-   **Gamification**: within two minutes, users felt, _“Wow — I can actually design.”_\n\nThis change was decisive. Fear turned into curiosity. Exploration replaced hesitation. Word-of-mouth exploded.\n\n---\n\n## 7. What Really Sustained Canva Wasn’t Luck\n\nLooking back, one counterintuitive truth stands out:\n\n> **Canva didn’t succeed because of a single flash of brilliance — but through relentless calibration around real problems.**\n\nMelanie summarized Canva’s core growth lessons from 0 to 1:\n\n1. **Solve real problems**\n   Build something people genuinely care about.\n2. **Offer a high-value free version**\n   A great free product accelerates organic growth.\n3. **Start niche, then expand**\n   Focus narrowly first (Fusion Books), then scale broadly (Canva).\n4. **Company-wide growth focus — beyond short-term wins**\n   Some teams work on long-term growth (global expansion, iPad/iPhone/Android), others on short-term optimization.\n5. **Organize around goals, not hierarchy**\n   Canva minimizes titles and sets ambitious goals for each team.\n6. **Obsess over onboarding**\n   Canva constantly tests and refines every detail.\n7. **Take SEO seriously**\n   If users search for you, they must find you.\n8. **Use data wisely**\n   A/B tests, user testing, surveys — each used in the right context.\n9. **Always deliver real value**\n   In both product and marketing.\n10. **Keep pricing accessible**\n    Cheaper, faster, more efficient products tend to win over time.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Founder Mindset: Staying Sane Under Pressure\n\nMelanie shared several practical habits:\n\n-   **Writing**: clarifies thinking and restores focus\n-   **Sleep**: non-negotiable\n-   **Vacations**: essential for recovery\n-   **Quiet time**: find what truly relaxes you — and protect it\n\n### Drawing Strength from Challenges\n\nMelanie once wrote to herself:\n\n> “You grow through challenges.\n> Your wildest dreams are built from what you lack.\n> Your courage comes from what you fear.\n> Your character strengthens every time you fall.\n> Your wisdom is born from mistakes.\n> Your future is shaped by your past.\n> Your sense of justice sharpens when you witness injustice.\n> And rainbows only appear after storms.”\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: There Is Only a Beginning — No Finish Line\n\nAt the end of the article, Melanie shared another journal entry — a message for all founders:\n\n> “Your wildest dreams are built from what you lack.\n> Your courage comes from what you fear.\n> Your character strengthens every time you fall.\n> Your wisdom is born from mistakes.\n> Treasure the challenges you face — these gaps are what push us forward.”\n\nFor Canva, becoming a unicorn was only the first step. Melanie’s next goal is to use the company’s power to create real, positive impact in the world.\n\n---\n\n## Final Notes\n\nThis long-form piece documents Canva’s journey from 0 to 1 — and from 1 to 100.\n\nAs Melanie often says, they “couldn’t believe their luck.”\nBut anyone who knows the full story understands: that luck was earned through courage and relentless effort.\n\n> **Even if a door opens just a crack — no matter how uncomfortable — you have to wedge your foot in.**\n\nThat may be the most honest description of entrepreneurship.\n\nSpecial thanks to Melanie for sharing her story. I hope this piece offers you a few moments of clarity and inspiration.","src/content/blog/en/the-decade-long-startup-journey-canva.md","b68d25058b07c32d",{"html":32,"metadata":33},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Preface\u003C/strong>\nThis article distills the key early-stage experiences of Canva founder Melanie Perkins, and attempts to answer three very practical questions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>How does someone without a business background discover real user needs?\u003C/strong>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>With no traffic and no resources, how do you land your first customers?\u003C/strong>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Without elite schools or big-tech credentials, why would investors take the bet?\u003C/strong>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"1-needs-are-not-invented--theyre-forced-into-existence\">1.

Canva 的十年创业历程","对Canva早期创业历程的深入探讨——如何发现真实用户需求、在资源匮乏的情况下赢得首批客户，以及为什么投资者支持了一位没有精英背景的创始人。",["Date","2025-12-25T00:00:00.000Z"],[19,20,21,22,23,24],"18 分钟","zh","> 导读：这篇文章，整理了 Canva 创始人 Melanie Perkins 在早期创业阶段的关键经历，试图回答三个更现实的问题：\n> **一个没有商业背景的人，如何发现真正的需求？没有流量、没有资源，如何拿到第一个客户？在没有名校和大厂履历的情况下，投资人为什么愿意下注？**\n\n## 一、需求不是想出来的，而是被逼出来的\n\n2008 年,Melanie 在珀斯上大学时兼职教设计课程。她发现当时的设计工具既笨重又难用,全是桌面端软件,新手需要花好几年培训才能掌握。\n\n而当时 Facebook 正风生水起——人们上手就能用,毫无门槛。这让 Melanie 萌生了一个想法:**做一款简单、在线、能协作的设计软件**。\n\n但她很清楚以她当时的能力，直接挑战 Adobe 这类巨头，并不理性。于是她换了个思路:从细分场景切入,先把这个理念用在学校年鉴上。\n\n当时澳大利亚的学校年鉴制作需要耗费数百个小时,负责人通常是普通教师,既要全职授课,又要牵头这么大一个项目,而且此前毫无设计经验。市场急需一个更好的解决方案。\n\n## 二、第一个产品，不是“最优解”，而是“能用的解”\n\nMelanie 并没有等到“万事俱备”，她画出极其详细的线框图，然后借钱雇佣外包团队开发第一版产品，在自家客厅里开始办公。\n\n![First edition design of Fusion Books](/images/blog/first-version-of-canva-design.png)\n这个阶段的目标非常明确，不是打造完美软件，而是验证**是否真的有人愿意为这个方案付钱。**\n\n> 这一步，对很多创业者来说反而最难——因为它要求你接受一个并不完美的开始。\n\n## 三、第一个客户，不是增长模型，而是“笨办法”\n\n产品上线后，他们没有渠道、没有品牌、没有营销经验。他们采用了最原始的获客方式：\n\n-   **直邮轰炸**：全家总动员，折页、贴邮票，给全澳洲的学校寄送宣传单。\n-   **电话销售**：给学校负责人打电话，并寄送免费的年鉴样本。\n    虽然过程繁琐，但这一步至关重要：Fusion Books 的盈利不仅让公司活了下来，更重要的是让他们从零学会了销售、客服和产品交付，深刻理解了用户为何买单。\n    也正是在这个过程中，Melanie 学到了一件极其重要的事：\n    > **真正的商业能力，不来自方法论，而来自亲自面对用户。要做出有足够价值的产品，让人们心甘情愿为它买单。**\n\n他们第一次收到 100 美元定金时，甚至犹豫过要不要把支票裱起来留作纪念。\n这就是第一个客户的意义：“**告诉自己这件事值得继续做下去**”。\n\n## 四、融资之路：没有“光鲜背景”如何打破偏见？\n\n在当时,投资者总在寻找成功企业家的\"固有模式\"——马克·扎克伯格的成功,让大多数投资人都在找他的翻版:\n\n-   哈佛、麻省理工、斯坦福的学历背景\n-   谷歌、苹果、Facebook 的前员工身份\n-   持续攀升的业绩图表\n\n任何偏离这些规律的特质,对创始人而言都是减分项。梅拉妮几乎踩中了所有“减分项”，但 Melanie 并非毫无积累：\n\n-   **他们曾与澳大利亚数百所学校合作,从产品开发、市场营销,到销售和客户服务,全流程亲力亲为,这让他们对用户需求有了深刻洞察。**\n-   **他们对未来的发展方向也有着清晰的愿景,更明确知道自己要解决什么问题。**\n\n为了打破僵局，她在旧金山滞留了三个月（原本计划两周），住在哥哥家的地板上。\n\n-   **死磕会议**：无论多早多晚，只要有人肯见，她一定到场。\n-   **信守承诺**：为了在承诺的截止日期前发出一份商业计划书，她连续熬夜 36 小时赶在 DDL 前发了过去。可能投资人根本不在乎什么时候发和有没有发，但是梅拉妮向来如此，说过的事，必须做到。同时，她也保证了商业计划书的质量——他们至今仍在践行其中的规划。\n    ![Melanie's pitch deck](/images/blog/melanie-pitch-deck.png)\n-   **投其所好**：得知关键投资人喜欢风筝冲浪，极度恐惧失控感的她硬着头皮去学，只为了能参加投资人的聚会。\n    她在给投资人的邮件中兴奋地写道：\n    “太兴奋了！刚风筝冲浪回来——真没想到这么好玩……顺便说一句，我找到了一位愿意降薪加入的技术大牛……”\n    正是这种近乎偏执的坚持，最终打动了早期投资人。\n\n## 五、商业计划书的进化：如何讲好一个故事？\n\nCanva 的 Pitch Deck（融资演示文稿）经历了几十个版本的迭代：\n\n比如很多投资人不了解设计行业,他们就加了这张幻灯片,解释设计的复杂流程:\n![Design workflow explanation](/images/blog/design-workflow-explanation.png)\n\n投资人无法想象这个市场有\"十亿美元级别的商机\",他们就加入市场规模分析:\n![Market size analysis](/images/blog/market-size-analysis.png)\nCanva 的目标是整合整个设计生态系统,浓缩到一个页面,让全球每个人都能简单易用:\n![Canva's vision](/images/blog/canva-vision.png)\n投资人听完整个演示,会说\"哦,这不就和某家公司一样吗?\"。于是,他们把市场差异分析提前,避免投资人反复问同样的问题:\n![Market differentiation](/images/blog/market-differentiation.png)\n他们还会问:\"如果有大公司砸 5 亿美元做这个项目怎么办?\"\nCanva 的回答是:在技术变革的巨大浪潮中,没有任何一家主导企业能长盛不衰,每个时代都会诞生新的市场领导者:\n![Market disruption](/images/blog/market-disruption.png)\nMelanie 在早期的 PPT 试图把 Canva 包装成“发明家”，效果很差。后来在建议下，他们加入了 Fusion Books 的营收数据（200 万美元营收，100% 同比增长）。这证明了他们不是在空谈，而是具备造血能力的创业者。\n\n每当投资人提出棘手问题,就会修改材料,**把最难的问题放在最前面**，主动解释投资人最可能误解的点。到演讲结束，投资人剩下的疑问已经寥寥无几。\n\n### 早期融资期，需要进行数百次推广才能获得关注，转折点是什么？\n\n梅拉妮意识到，与其询问投资人是否愿意投资，不如先主动征求他们的意见。这样他们就不会被直接拒绝，反而能让投资人对他们产生兴趣——听完投资人的建议，梅拉妮针对性修改商业计划书，也会后续再次寻找“建议”留有余地。\n随着他们收到的“建议”越来越少，他们的愿景越来越清晰，对他们感兴趣的人也越来越多。之后他们顺利的完成了种子轮融资。\n\n## 六、产品冷启动：打破用户的“恐惧感”\n\n### 用户测试：发现真实问题\n\nCanva 上线前，Waiting List（候补名单）已有 5 万人。但当他们进行用户测试时，结果却是灾难性的：\n用户不敢轻易点击，即使点击了也会漫无目的地浏览，遇到不少障碍，最终做出的产品平平无奇，最后沮丧离开。\n这和 Canva 期待的愉悦用户体验相去甚远。Canva 团队很快意识到，阻碍人们做出优秀设计的，不仅是工具本身，还有他们内心“自己不会设计”的心理门槛。\n\n### 引导优化：改变用户认知\n\nCanva 要成功,关键在于让用户在上手几分钟内就获得绝佳体验。于是他们彻底重构了新手引导流程（Onboarding）：\n\n-   不再直接扔给用户一张白纸：\n-   设计了一系列微任务，例如“把圆圈变成红色”、“给猴子戴上帽子”。\n-   Gamification（游戏化）：让用户在 2 分钟内获得“哇！原来我也会设计”的成就感。\n    这一改动是决定性的。用户从“害怕尝试”变成了“主动探索”，口碑开始爆发式增长。\n\n## 七、真正支撑 Canva 走到今天的，不是运气\n\n回看 Canva 的早期阶段，会发现一个反直觉的事实：\n**它的成功，不是源于某个“灵光乍现”，而是长期围绕“真实问题”反复校准。**\n\n梅拉妮总结了 Canva 从 0 到 1 的核心增长经验：\n\n1. 解决实际问题\n   最关键的因素,是打造一款能解决很多人真正关心的实际问题的产品。\n2. 提供高价值的免费版本\n   如果能推出高价值的免费版本,自然会助力产品更快传播。\n3. 从细分市场入手,逐步拓展\n   先聚焦细分市场(借助 Fusion),再拓展到更广泛的领域(推出 Canva),让 Canva 能够深入理解用户需求,并精准解决问题。\n4. 全公司聚焦增长,但不止步于短期优化\n   每个人要么投身长期增长计划,要么专注短期优化。比如产品国际化、在 iPad、iPhone 和安卓应用等新平台推出 Canva,这些都能开拓新市场,属于长期增长计划。\n5. 以目标为核心构建公司架构\n   过去那种僵化的层级结构,显然不适用于快速发展的初创公司。Canva 为每个团队设定\"远大目标\",弱化头衔概念。每个团队都有明确目标,达成后共同庆祝。\n6. 打造优质用户引导体验\n   让用户快速感受到产品价值,进而主动分享。Canva 频繁使用 usertesting.com 测试产品、观察用户反应,投入大量时间完善每一个细节。\n7. 重视搜索引擎优化(SEO)\n   当用户主动搜索你的产品时,务必让他们能顺利找到,这是不可或缺的增长助力。\n8. 善用各类数据\n   并不是一味使用 A/B 测试。关键是在合适的场景使用合适的数据——从 usertesting.com 测试、A/B 测试,到用户调查、谷歌调查等,都要合理运用。\n9. 提供真正的价值\n   无论是产品本身还是营销环节,这一点都至关重要,其影响力不容低估。\n10. 力求产品价格亲民\n    当然这并非适用于所有场景,但一个明显的宏观趋势是,大多数事物都在变得更便宜、更快捷、更高效。这样做既能促进公平,也有利于业务发展。\n\n## 八、创业心态：在压力中保持理智\n\nMelanie 分享了几个实用的方法:\n\n-   **写作**：写作时思路清晰且专注，不再任由思绪杂乱飘荡，而是能有意识地聚焦于某件事。\n-   **睡眠**：充足的睡眠至关重要。\n-   **假期**：假期能让人满血复活，偶尔让大脑休息，才能以更饱满的状态回归生活。\n-   **安静时光**：找到适合自己的放松方式，并坚持下去，很重要。\n\n### 从挑战中汲取力量\n\nMelanie 写给自己的一段话:\n「你在面对挑战的过程中不断成长。\n你最狂野的梦想,由你所欠缺的东西铸就。\n你的冒险精神,源于你所恐惧的事物。\n你的品格力量,在每一次跌倒后愈发坚韧。\n你的智慧,从犯错中孕育而生。\n你的未来,由你的过去塑造。\n你的正义感,因目睹不公而愈发强烈。\n彩虹,总在风雨后出现。」\n\n## 结语：只有起步，没有终点\n\n文章最后，梅拉妮分享了她在日记中写给自己的一段话，这也是送给所有创业者的寄语：\n“你最狂野的梦想，由你所欠缺的东西铸就。\n你的冒险精神，源于你所恐惧的事物。\n你的品格力量，在每一次跌倒后愈发坚韧。\n你的智慧，从犯错中孕育而生。\n请珍惜你所面临的挑战，正是这些‘缺口’，激励着我们不断前行。”\n对于 Canva 而言，成为独角兽只是第一步。梅拉妮的下一个目标，是利用企业的力量，对世界产生真正积极的影响。\n\n## 写在最后\n\n这篇长文记录了 Canva 从 0 到 1,从 1 到 100 的艰辛历程。\n就像 Melanie 多次提到的,他们\"简直不敢相信自己的运气!\"但了解过他们故事的人一定明白,这些运气都来自于勇气和努力。\n**当一扇门哪怕只开了一条缝,就算挤着难受,也得把脚伸进去**——这或许就是创业者最真实的写照。\n非常感谢 Melanie 的慷慨分享,希望这篇博客能给你带来一些启发。","src/content/blog/zh/the-decade-long-startup-journey-canva.md","7864229e745b5e69",{"html":99,"metadata":100},"\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>导读：这篇文章，整理了 Canva 创始人 Melanie Perkins

的回答是:在技术变革的巨大浪潮中,没有任何一家主导企业能长盛不衰,每个时代都会诞生新的市场领导者:\n\u003Cimg src=\"/images/blog/market-disruption.png\" alt=\"Market disruption\">\nMelanie 在早期的 PPT 试图把 Canva 包装成“发明家”，效果很差。后来在建议下，他们加入了 Fusion Books 的营收数据（200 万美元营收，100% 同比增长）。这证明了他们不是在空谈，而是具备造血能力的创业者。\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>每当投资人提出棘手问题,就会修改材料,\u003Cstrong>把最难的问题放在最前面\u003C/strong>，主动解释投资人最可能误解的点。到演讲结束，投资人剩下的疑问已经寥寥无几。\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"早期融资期需要进行数百次推广才能获得关注转折点是什么\">早期融资期，需要进行数百次推广才能获得关注，转折点是什么？\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>梅拉妮意识到，与其询问投资人是否愿意投资，不如先主动征求他们的意见。这样他们就不会被直接拒绝，反而能让投资人对他们产生兴趣——听完投资人的建议，梅拉妮针对性修改商业计划书，也会后续再次寻找“建议”留有余地。\n随着他们收到的“建议”越来越少，他们的愿景越来越清晰，对他们感兴趣的人也越来越多。之后他们顺利的完成了种子轮融资。\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2

万人。但当他们进行用户测试时，结果却是灾难性的：\n用户不敢轻易点击，即使点击了也会漫无目的地浏览，遇到不少障碍，最终做出的产品平平无奇，最后沮丧离开。\n这和 Canva 期待的愉悦用户体验相去甚远。Canva 团队很快意识到，阻碍人们做出优秀设计的，不仅是工具本身，还有他们内心“自己不会设计”的心理门槛。\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"引导优化改变用户认知\">引导优化：改变用户认知\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Canva 要成功,关键在于让用户在上手几分钟内就获得绝佳体验。于是他们彻底重构了新手引导流程（Onboarding）：\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>不再直接扔给用户一张白纸：\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>设计了一系列微任务，例如“把圆圈变成红色”、“给猴子戴上帽子”。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Gamification（游戏化）：让用户在 2

的早期阶段，会发现一个反直觉的事实：\n\u003Cstrong>它的成功，不是源于某个“灵光乍现”，而是长期围绕“真实问题”反复校准。\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>梅拉妮总结了 Canva 从 0 到 1 的核心增长经验：\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>解决实际问题\n最关键的因素,是打造一款能解决很多人真正关心的实际问题的产品。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>提供高价值的免费版本\n如果能推出高价值的免费版本,自然会助力产品更快传播。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>从细分市场入手,逐步拓展\n先聚焦细分市场(借助 Fusion),再拓展到更广泛的领域(推出 Canva),让 Canva 能够深入理解用户需求,并精准解决问题。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>全公司聚焦增长,但不止步于短期优化\n每个人要么投身长期增长计划,要么专注短期优化。比如产品国际化、在 iPad、iPhone 和安卓应用等新平台推出 Canva,这些都能开拓新市场,属于长期增长计划。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>以目标为核心构建公司架构\n过去那种僵化的层级结构,显然不适用于快速发展的初创公司。Canva 为每个团队设定”远大目标”,弱化头衔概念。每个团队都有明确目标,达成后共同庆祝。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>打造优质用户引导体验\n让用户快速感受到产品价值,进而主动分享。Canva 频繁使用 usertesting.com 测试产品、观察用户反应,投入大量时间完善每一个细节。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>重视搜索引擎优化(SEO)\n当用户主动搜索你的产品时,务必让他们能顺利找到,这是不可或缺的增长助力。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>善用各类数据\n并不是一味使用 A/B 测试。关键是在合适的场景使用合适的数据——从 usertesting.com 测试、A/B 测试,到用户调查、谷歌调查等,都要合理运用。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>提供真正的价值\n无论是产品本身还是营销环节,这一点都至关重要,其影响力不容低估。\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>力求产品价格亲民\n当然这并非适用于所有场景,但一个明显的宏观趋势是,大多数事物都在变得更便宜、更快捷、更高效。这样做既能促进公平,也有利于业务发展。\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch2
