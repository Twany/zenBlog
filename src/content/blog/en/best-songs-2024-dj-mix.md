This was one of the hardest year-end mixes to make so far, simply because there were too many great tracks to choose from in 2024. Fitting them all into one hour was an impossible task. 58 tracks was possible though, and this year continued the huge diversity of tempos that now make up the modern dancefloor, from slow disco to rapid-fire techno.

## The Process

I started by curating a list of over **500 tracks** that I loved this year. From there, it was a process of whittling them down to the absolute essentials. The focus was on flow and energy, ensuring that the mix tells a story from start to finish.

### Track Selection Criteria

Here is how I ranked the tracks:

1. **Vibe**: Does it make you want to move?
2. **Production Quality**: Is the mix clean?
3. **Originality**: Have I heard this bassline 100 times before?

| Rank | Artist | Track | Genre |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Fred Again.. | Places to Be | Electronic |
| 2 | Peggy Gou | 1+1=11 | House |
| 3 | Overmono | Blow Out | Techno |

## Key Tracks

Standout tracks include the new release from **Fred Again..**, the disco revival hit from **Purple Disco Machine**, and some underground gems that defined the club scene in Berlin this summer.
